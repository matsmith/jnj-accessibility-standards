		<h3 data-icon="add">Color contrast</h3>

		<p>The level of contrast between foreground and background colors affects usability—more contrast makes it easier to distinguish characters and symbols. So it’s important to ensure that there is significant contrast between the color of text and its background color, so that is easily readable. This is particularly important for people with visual impairments that affect visual acuity or color perception.</p>

		<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><p>Text overtop the hero image</p><img src="./img/text-over-background.png"/></td>
			<td>Darken the foreground color to at least  #2F3232 to increase its color-contrast ratio to 4.6:1</td>

			<td>
				<p>Gray text surrounding the video thumbnails that’s overtop the appendages of the woman in the background</p>

		<p><strong>WCAG 2.0 – 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)</strong></p>
		<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.</p>


		<!-- SUB SECTION -->
		<h3 data-icon="add">Information imparted through color alone</h3>

		<p>Color is an important asset in the design of web content, enhancing its aesthetic appeal, usability, and its accessibility. Some users, however, have difficulty perceiving color. People with partial sight often experience limited color vision, and many older users don’t see color well.</p>

		<h4>Recommendations</h4>

		<p>Whenever color is used to convey information, make sure that the information is available without needing to see the color. For example, you could add a clearly perceivable border to form fields that are invalid or—even better—you could add a blurb of text alongside the fields that may have errors.</p>

		<h4>Related Standards</h4>

		<p><strong>WCAG 2.0 – 1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A)</strong></p>
		<p>Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.</p>
