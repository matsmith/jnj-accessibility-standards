		<h3 data-icon="add">Button</h3>

		<p>The site has many elements that, to the average user, would probably be thought of as "buttons", such as "Close" buttons, menu buttons, "Choose X" buttons, and the like. In the site’s current implementation, however, many of the site's "buttons" are coded using other elements, such as links or <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s rather than <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements.</p>

		<p>Keyboard users often use the Tab key to cycle through the focusable elements within a page, but would-be buttons that are created through elements like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s aren't keyboard accessible because there’s no means to focus them.</p>

		<p>When links are used for "buttons", the elements are often focusable, but users may misinfer the elements' purpose if they were to assume that the link is going to take them to another page (or to another area within the current page).</p>

		<p>For instance, if a screen-reader user were to come across a link that said "View Transcript", they might assume that clicking on it would take them to another page (rather than being displayed within an overlay). </p>
		
		<h4>Recommendations</h4>

		<p>As a rule of thumb, other than elements that are literally links, clickable controls should be created with <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements.</p>

		<p>For instance, all the interactive elements within the home page’s "Skills for Life" (at the time of this document creation) would be suitable as <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements: the video thumbnail, the “Play Video” button, and the “View Transcript” button.</p>

		<figure class="preCode">The aria-label attribute overrides the description that screen readers would normally announce for an element. So in this case, the aria-label attribute ensures that screen-reader users will hear “View Skills for Life Transcript” rather than “View Transcript”, which may be ambiguous.</figure>
		<textarea class="brush:html">
			<button aria-label="View Skills for Life Transcript">View Transcript</button>
		</textarea>

		<p>If you're have no way around using an anchor element to create a "button", you'll need to either include the href attribute with an empty fragment identifier (href="#") or add tabindex="0" to the link so that it’s included in the keyboard tab order. If you use an empty fragment identifier (such as href="#"), you’ll also need to cancel the default action for the anchor element when it’s activated—if you don’t, an anchor with an empty fragment identifier will place focus at the start of the page.</p>

		<p>You'll also need to add some JavaScript to make the would-be button accept to the same keyboard controls as native <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements. Namely, you’ll need to add keypress event handlers to the element to ensure that if someone focuses the element and presses Enter or Space, the element will react just the same as if they had clicked it. For instance, if you were to have a "View Transcript" link that acts like a button, you'd need to ensure that users could focus the element and press Enter or Space to trigger the transcript's overlay.</p>

		<figure class="preCode">Example of link that acts like a button</figure>
		<textarea class="brush:html">
			<a role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="View Skills for Life Transcript">View Transcript</a>
		</textarea>

		<p>Given the effort involved in creating "buttons" from whole cloth, we recommend using native <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements for clickable controls wherever you can. </p>

		<h3 data-icon="add">Dropdown menus</h3>

		<p>We're using the term "dropdown menu" to describe navigation menus such as the "hamburger" menu (which is in the top-left corner of the dashboard) as well as the "profile" menu (which in the top-right corner of the dashboard).</p>

		<p>In their current implementation, the dropdown menus within the site use mostly semantic markup. But they aren’t accessible to keyboard users, and, and they don’t have the corresponding ARIA properties to convey their current state.</p>

		<h4>Recommendations</h4>

		<p>Here’s the markup recommended for inline dropdown menus without a close button:</p>

		<textarea class="brush:html">
			<button aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
			    Judy Blume
			    <span class="visuallyhidden">Profile</span>
			    <i aria-hidden="true" class="icon-user-profile"> </i>
			</button>
			<nav>
			    <ul>
			        <li><a href="/mhmsite/my-profile">View My Account</a></li>
			        <li><a href="/mhmsite/program/hra">Go to Succeed</a></li>
			        <li><a href="/mhmsite/logout">Logout</a></li>
			    </ul>
			</nav>
		</textarea>

		<p>And here’s the markup recommended for full-screen dropdown menus with a close button:</p>

		<textarea class="brush:html">
			<button aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
			    <i aria-hidden="true" class="icon-hamburger-stack">  </i>
			    Menu
			</button>
			<nav>
			    <button>
			        <span class="visuallyhidden">Close</span>
			        <i aria-hidden="true" class="icon-sans-close">  </i>
			    </button>
			    <ul>
			        <li class="home first active"><a href="/mhmsite/">Home</a></li>
			        <li class="program-coaching"><a href="/mhmsite/program-coaching">Coaching</a></li>
			        <li class="todolist"><a href="/mhmsite/todolist">To Do List</a></li>
			        <li class="health-tools"><a href="/mhmsite/health-tools">Tools</a></li>
			        <li class="resources last"><a href="/mhmsite/resources">Resources</a></li>
			    </ul>
			</nav>
		</textarea>

		<p>The key accessibility and ARIA roles and states are:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/CR-wai-aria-20110118/states_and_properties#aria-haspopup">aria-haspopup</a> &mdash; indicates that a button item has a sub-menu associated with it. (For dropdown menus, this should always be set to true.)</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-expanded">aria-expanded</a> &mdash; indicates that a menu is open (which usually implies it is visually expanded on-screen). Set this to true when the dropdown is visible and false when the dropdown is closed.</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-hidden">aria-hidden</a> &mdash; tells screen readers to ignore these elements. This attribute is used on elements containing icon-font icons, and aria-hidden ensures that screen readers don’t attempt to pronounce the Unicode characters that create those icons.</li>
			<li><code>&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> &mdash; provides text equivalents for icon-font icons. In this example, for instance, this tells screen readers that the "X" icon is a "Close" button. (This technique is discussed in more detail in the section on "Alternative text for icon-font icons.")</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The menu button must support the following keystrokes:</p>

		<p><strong>Enter</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>When the top-level button is focused: Open the dropdown menu and leave focus on the originating <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element.</li>
			<li>When the close button is focused: Close the dropdown and programmatically focus the top-level <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>.</li>
			<li>When a link is focused: The link is clicked (normal behavior).</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Tab</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>When the top-level button is focused but the dropdown is closed: Focus moves to the next visible focusable item within the page. (This behavior should happen automatically; it shouldn’t require any special programming.)</li>
			<li>When the top-level button is focused and the dropdown is open: Focus moves to the first focusable item in the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> area—which will be either the "Close" <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> (if there is one) or the first link in the list. (This behavior should happen automatically; it shouldn’t require any special programming.)</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Esc</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Close the dropdown menu and programmatically focus the top-level <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>.</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- SUB SECTION -->
		<h3 data-icon="add">Dialog/Modal overlay markup</h3>

		<p>The site makes use of several modal dialogs, including the overlays for the videos and video transcripts (on the home page) as well as overlays to convey error messages in some instances.</p>

		<p>The pop-up overlays are modal, which means all content 'behind' them must be hidden from the perspective of keyboard and assistive-technology users. But there are a number of situations where it's possible to navigate outside of the overlay and into the page below, either by using the Tab key or the 'virtual cursor' in screen readers.</p>

		<h4>Recommendations</h4>

		<p>All overlays should have a role of dialog if the user may need to interact with the contents of the overlay, or a role of alertdialog if the overlay contains a brief set of content that should automatically be read to the user.</p>

		<p>So for instance, the overlays for error messages should use <code>role="alertdialog"</code> because users would want to be able to hear those errors as soon as the overlay appears. But on the other hand, the overlays for the videos and video transcripts would be better suited with role="dialog"—because with the video overlays, users may need to interact with the videos' controls, and with the transcript overlays, users may prefer to ingest the transcripts at their own pace (rather than having the transcripts automatically read aloud in their entirety).</p>

		<p><strong>The key accessibility and ARIA roles and states are:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-labelledby">aria-labelledby</a> &mdash; indicates the IDs of the elements that should be form the label for the overlay. So in the case of most overlays, their aria-labelledby attribute would point to the ID of whichever heading element is at the top of the overlay.</li>
			<li><code>tabindex="-1"</code> &mdash; ensures that the containing element can be programmatically focused through JavaScript.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Properties just for ordinary overlays:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#dialog">role="dialog"</a></code> &mdash; tells assistive technologies that this element is an ordinary overlay.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Properties just for alert dialogs:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#alertdialog">role="alertdialog"</a></code> &mdash; tells assistive technologies that this element is an overlay with an alert.</li>
			<li><code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-describedby">aria-describedby</a></code> &mdash; indicates which element should be read aloud automatically when the overlay is shown. (The example code happens to use id=”overlay-content” for the element containing the content, but feel free to use whichever ID you might like—as long as the overlay’s aria-describedby attribute matches that ID.)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>All background content should be hidden using the aria-hidden attribute (aria-hidden="true") to help further prevent screen-reader users from accidentally navigating into the background content using virtual keystrokes.</p>

		<!-- SUB SECTION -->
		<h3 data-icon="add">Title attribute</h3>

		<p>Some controls have a redundant title attribute that repeats the control name. This can cause screen readers to announce the control label twice.</p>

		<h4>Recommendations</h4>

		<p>As a rule of thumb, don't use title attributes on links or buttons or other elements—because that can lead to screen-reader users hearing those announcements twice. (There are a few rare edge cases where a <code>title</code> attribute may be of use, but other than those instances—which are called out within this document—you can assume that all other elements should have their <code>title</code> attributes removed.)</p>

		<p>The <code>title</code> attribute is only intended to provide supplementary information. Instead, label links and controls using their respective alternative-text mechanisms (such as <code>alt</code> attributes for images and <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> elements for inputs).</p>

		<p>The recommended markup below, for the "Forgot User Name" and "or Password" links, represents one of the rare edge case where a <code>title</code> attribute can be of use. While the "Forgot User Name" link is descriptive enough on its own—and so it shouldn't have a <code>title</code> attribute—there's a chance that the "or Password?" link could be ambiguous if a screen-reader user were to come across that link out of context. So in this specific case, the <code>title</code> attribute on “or Password?” can be retained since its <code>title</code> attribute helps more fully describe the link's purpose.</p>
