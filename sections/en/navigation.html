		<p>Keyboard users navigate web pages sequentially by moving from one focusable element (such as a link or form control/input) to the next. It is essential, therefore, that all functionality is implemented in a way that allows keyboard users to focus and activate any "trigger" elements on the page, otherwise they may be prevented from navigating between pages or completing specific tasks.</p>

		<p><strong>Close button does not receive focus</strong></p>

		<p>The close "X" used to back out of the Balance coaching is not reachable via keyboard. Screen reader and keyboard only  users will not be able to interact with this control. Keyboard only users, in particular, will find this frustrating since they will be able to see the control on the screen that they will not be allowed to interact with.</p>

		<p><strong>Dialog close button</strong></p>

		<p>The "X" control used to dismiss dialogs is not reachable via keyboard. To compound the issue, these dialogs are not able to be dismissed via the ESC key which is a common design pattern for this type of component.</p>

		<figure class="extra">
			<img src="./img/dialog-close-focus.png"/>
		</figure>

		<h4>Recommendations</h4>

		<p>Ensure that all actionable elements are reachable and can be operated using the keyboard alone, and that elements that are not actionable are not included in the keyboard tab order.</p>

		<p>Ideally, button elements should be created using native HTML elements that expose a role of button (input with a type of button, submit or image, or a button element), as these elements also work with the correct keyboard behavior. The browser then handles all the keyboard support for native elements.</p>

		<p><strong>WCAG 2.0 – 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)</strong></p>

		<p>All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.</p>

		<p><strong>WCAG 2.0 – 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)</strong></p>

		<p>For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.</p>


		<!-- SUB SECTION -->
		<h3 data-icon="add">Bypass blocks</h3>

		<p>Navigation links are the lists or "menus" of links to all the sections of a site that are often repeated on every page. As navigation links are typically placed at the beginning (top) of pages, screen reader users and sighted keyboard-only users are often required to read through all the navigation links before reaching the main area of the page.</p>

		<p>Most tested pages did not have skip links, while others had them but they were not shown on focus. This adds an unexplained focus stop to keyboard only users and deprives them of functionality that they would otherwise find helpful.</p>

		<h4>Recommnedations</h4>

		<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">WAI ARIA specification</a> defines a set of specialized landmark roles. These roles provide a method to programmatically identify commonly found regions of web content in a consistent way, and allow assistive technologies to provide users with features they can use to identify and navigate to sections of the page.</p>
		
		<p>The following landmark roles can be used:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><code>banner</code></li>
			<li><code>complementary</code></li>
			<li><code>contentinfo</code></li>
			<li><code>main</code></li>
			<li><code>navigation</code></li>
			<li><code>search</code></li>
			<li><code>application</code></li>
		</ul>

		<p>To add landmark regions to an HTML document, identify the logical structure of the document. All content should be contained within a region so that screen reader users can be sure to get to all content, and not miss orphaned content. Add the landmark to the element containing the area of the content as a <code>role</code> attribute with the value corresponding to the list of roles above.</p>

		<p>For example, identify the main (unique) content on the page by adding <code>role="main"</code> to a containing <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element.</p>

		<textarea class="brush:html">
			<div class="container" role="main">
		</textarea>

		<h3 data-icon="add">Page and iFrame titles</h3>

		<p><strong>Incorrect page titles within Single Page Application</strong></p>

		<p>While some pages do correctly use the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element, many of the tested pages lacked unique or meaningful titles, relying instead on generic section titles such as "Digital Health Coaching."</p>

		<p><strong>Titles missing for iframes</strong></p>

		<p>Properly titled iFrames help users quickly navigate and understand the content of an iFrame without having to interact with the content. When these frames are not properly titled, their purpose or meaning is not properly conveyed to the user.</p>

		<h4>Recommendations</h4>

		<p>Using the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element, make sure that each page has a unique page title that adequately summarizes the page content. For helpful wayfinding, a general rule of thumb is to use the following format: Page title – Section title – Application title. This format describes the current page as well as the current content, providing a "you are here" function.</p>

		<h3 data-icon="add">Focus and document flow</h3>

		<p>Keyboard navigation involves using certain keys to move keyboard focus around the elements on the screen, and other keys to select the element that currently has keyboard focus. When keyboard commands trigger unexpected actions, the resulting change of context is disorienting.</p>

		<p>There are few notable instances in the tested views where focus is not properly managed, leading to either a loss in focus or the user being able to navigate away from an area of the page when they should not be able to.</p>

		<p>When a dialog is opened, focus is not moved to the window, instead the user is able to navigate around the page behind it.</p>

		<figure class="extra">
			System dialogs are not focused on when displayed
			<img src="./img/prompt-dialog-focus.png"/>
		</figure>

		<h4>Recommendations</h4>

		<p>Avoid attaching unexpected behaviors to controls. Unless change is expected and a direct result of user input, focus should remain on the trigger element and move forward as expected. </p>

		<p>If a user opens a dialog, focus should be returned to that control when the dialog is dismissed. When loading additional information, such as additional articles generated by a "Read More" button, focus should move to the first new article.</p>

		<p>When focus is moved to a menu that the user has opened, focus should remain inside that menu until the user makes a selection or closes it with the <code>ESC</code> key.</p>

		<p>The non-keyboard specific portions of the WAI-ARIA design patterns for menus and dialogs must be adhered to. For information on the expected behavior refer to:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><code>Dialog modal</code></li>
			<li><code>Menu</code></li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>WCAG 2.0 – 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)</strong></p>

		<p>If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.</p>


		<!-- SUB SECTION -->
		<h3 data-icon="add">Visible focus</h3>

		<p>Sighted keyboard-only users navigate websites by moving focus sequentially through the page (using TAB/SHIFT+TAB to move the focus from one focusable element – such as a link or form control/input – to the next). While the text is underlined on hover, on many of the pages that were tested, indication of focus for keyboard users (with the exception of global nav and footer) falls back to the browser default. This makes it difficult for this user group to determine where their cursor currently is within the content.</p>

		<p>It is imperative that interactive elements such as links, button, tabs and form select combo box controls clearly indicate when they have focus (i.e. focus indication should have high visual contrast). Otherwise sighted people who use a keyboard to interact with the website will not be able to determine their current position within the page.</p>

		<p>Throughout all tested pages there were significant issues with visible focus. In some cases, the browser default was used which is often insufficient. And in others there was no indication at all.</p>

		<figure class="extra">
			In the example below, there is not visible indication of focus. Focus is on the Contact Us link.
			<img src="./img/text-focus.png"/>
		</figure>

		<h4>Recommendations</h4>

		<p>Provide a clearly visible indication of focus for all interactive elements. Developers that use CSS for presentation will typically use the hover pseudo class for indicating that the mouse is over an element, but overlook similar functionality for keyboard only users. For anchor and input elements, this is simply a case of including a focus pseudo class to provide the same information mouse users get when they hover over an element.</p>

		<p>Any styles that applied, or changed on <code>:hover</code> must be also be observed on <code>:focus</code>.</p>

		<p>For example where a CSS rule is set to indicate mouse hover on a link, add <code>a: active</code> (due to a bug in earlier versions of IE (before version 8), the <code>active</code> pseudo class must also be used) and <code>a:focus</code>, which will result in the same style being applied on focus.</p>

		<p>The following recommendations should be applied together:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Do not use CSS <code>outline: none</code> to hide the default focus indicator.</li>
			<li>Provide indications of focus in the same manner and style that indications of mouse hover are provided.</li>
			<li>Provide an indication of focus for input <code>type="image"</code> and links containing only an image.</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- SUB SECTION -->
		<h3 data-icon="add">Focus and reading order</h3>

		<p>Users that navigate with a keyboard (both sighted users and users with assistive technology such as screen readers) will generally use Tab/Shift+Tab to move sequentially from one focusable element in the page to the next. By default, the order in which elements receive focus is determined by the order in which these elements are present in the document's markup. If this source order is not logical, users will have difficulty understanding the purpose/structure of the document and may miss important information and functionality.</p>

		<p>While most of My HealthMedia follows a logical and intuitive order, there were noticeable instances where reading order deviates from this standard.</p>

		<p>In the following example, CSS floats are incorrectly used in place of a logical reading order.</p>

		<figure class="extra">
			Floating elements creates bad focus flow using a keyboard
			<img src="./img/order.png"/>
		</figure>

		<h4>Recommendations</h4>

		<p>Make sure that the order in which elements receive keyboard focus, or are discovered by the user, follow a meaningful and logical sequence. Pay attention to code order; the tab order must make sense visually, but also match the HTML element order. Sequencing elements in the code so they follow a logical order helps to provide a logical and meaningful focus order.</p>
